      <h2>Why You Should Always Read the Contract</h2>
      <p>
        As a freelancer, your contract is your only legal protection. Without a clear agreement, you risk:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not getting paid on time (or at all)</li>
        <li>Getting asked to do more work than agreed</li>
        <li>Losing rights to your own work</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here’s a quick checklist of what to look for — plus how you can use AI to simplify the legal jargon.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Scope of Work</h2>
      <p>
        Make sure it clearly defines what you’re expected to deliver. Vague language like “as needed” or “to be determined” opens the door to scope creep.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> No specific deliverables or deadlines.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Payment Terms</h2>
      <p>
        How much you’ll get paid, and when. Is it per project, per hour, or per milestone? Check for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Net 30 vs Net 15 vs “upon completion”</li>
        <li>Late payment fees</li>
        <li>Deposit requirements</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Intellectual Property (IP) Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Does the client own the work after payment, or do you retain rights? Some contracts may assign *all* rights even if you haven’t been paid yet.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for words like “work for hire” or “assignment of rights”.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Termination Clause</h2>
      <p>
        Can the client cancel the contract mid-project? Are you owed payment for work completed? A missing or unfair clause could leave you with nothing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Confidentiality & Non-Compete</h2>
      <p>
        A confidentiality clause is normal — but watch out for overly broad non-compete terms that prevent you from working in your field.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Revision Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Some clients will ask for unlimited changes unless the contract limits them. Make sure your time is protected.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Safe standard:</strong> 1–2 rounds of revisions, with extra rounds billed hourly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        If there’s a disagreement, where and how is it handled? Arbitration clauses may limit your ability to sue — check the “jurisdiction” too.
      </p>
