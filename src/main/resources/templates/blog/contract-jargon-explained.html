        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">Why Legal Jargon Matters</h2>
        <p>Hidden in almost every agreement are a few words that carry major legal consequences. Whether you're signing a lease, NDA, or service contract, understanding these terms is critical to protecting your rights.</p>
        <p>Below are 10 of the most common (and often misunderstood) legal terms you should know — with simple explanations and examples.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">1. <strong>Indemnify</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> You agree to cover someone else's losses or legal fees if something goes wrong.</p>
        <p><strong>Example clause:</strong> “The Client agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Service Provider…”</p>
        <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> “If something bad happens, you’ll cover their legal costs.”</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">2. <strong>Force Majeure</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> A contract doesn’t apply during extreme events like natural disasters or war.</p>
        <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> “We’re not responsible if something totally out of our control prevents us from doing what we promised.”</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">3. <strong>Severability</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> If one part of the contract is invalid, the rest still holds.</p>
        <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> “Even if one clause is legally wrong, the rest of the contract still works.”</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">4. <strong>Arbitration</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Disputes will be settled by a neutral third party, not in court.</p>
        <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> “If there's a fight, you’ll go to a private judge instead of a courtroom.”</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">5. <strong>Jurisdiction</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> The location (state or country) whose laws will apply.</p>
        <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> “If something goes wrong, this is the place where legal action will happen.”</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">6. <strong>Termination Clause</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Outlines when and how either party can end the agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> “This is how you can legally get out of the contract — and what it will cost.”</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">7. <strong>Confidentiality</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> You agree not to share certain information.</p>
        <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> “You’re legally required to keep this information private.”</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">8. <strong>Entire Agreement</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Everything both parties agreed to is written in this document — nothing else counts.</p>
        <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> “What’s written here is final. Verbal promises don’t matter.”</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">9. <strong>Assignment</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> One party may or may not be allowed to transfer their obligations to someone else.</p>
        <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> “Can the company hand off this contract to another business? This clause tells you.”</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">10. <strong>Waiver</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> If someone ignores a contract term once, it doesn’t mean they’ve given it up forever.</p>
        <p><strong>Plain English:</strong> “Just because they didn’t enforce something one time doesn’t mean they can’t later.”</p>
