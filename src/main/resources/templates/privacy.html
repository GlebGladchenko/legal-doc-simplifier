    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="effective-date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 7, 2025</div>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how NovaSyntax LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our AI-powered legal document simplifier (“Service”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Uploaded Documents:</strong> Documents you submit are processed temporarily via third-party AI providers such as OpenAI. We do not store document content after processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Your IP address, browser type, device information, and timestamps may be automatically collected for security and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We may use minimal cookies or session storage to improve functionality. You can disable cookies in your browser settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
