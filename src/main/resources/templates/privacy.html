        </ul>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <li><strong>Cookies and Unique Identifiers:</strong> We may assign a random, anonymous unique ID (UUID) via cookies to help track usage limits and identify unique users. This cookie does not store personal data and is not used for advertising.</li>

        <h2 class="subtitle is-4 mt-5">3. File Storage and Processing</h2>
        <p>Uploaded documents, audio, or video files are processed in-memory and never stored on our servers. All AI processing is performed by trusted providers such as OpenAI and Whisper.
